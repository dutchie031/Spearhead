# Spearhead


## Contributing. 

I'm always happy to see contributions! <br/>
Especially if you've found an issue, annoyance or feature that you know how to solve, fix or create! <br/>

### Keep it small. 

Keeping your contributions small and to the point helps both me and yourself. <br/>
It'll help the PR review and the speed of improvements. <br/>
If you have a big feature in mind? Go for it! <br/>
Does it require an entire refactor of parts or all of the program? Maybe make sure to do step 0 first.

### Steps (for first timers)
0. Reach out (Optional)

If you want to let me know you want to do something to contribute, please do! <br/>
Maybe I'm already working on the thing you wanted to build, or someone else is. <br/>
Creating an issue is even better! <br/>


1. Fork the repository

By forking you can create your own working set of code. <br/>
Whether you keep that fork public or private is up to you! <br/>

Keep in mind, forking is alright, but it's best with the intent to contribute back. <br/>
After all, instead of having 5 slightly different versions and products, it might be nicer to have 1 much better version. <br/>

2. Create a Draft PR as soon as possible!

As soon as you've found some times to create an initial version, please create a draft PR. <br/>
That way you can let me and everyone know it's being worked on and people can see what conflicts might arise with their own changes. <br/>

3. Test, test, test

With DCS and Lua there's a bunch of edge cases that are really hard to get to. <br/>
However, you kinda need to make sure most if not all cases are caught and tested. <br/>
Since automated testing for now doesn't seem feasible, please make sure to verify and test functionality after touching stuff. <br/>

4. Finalise and publish the PR. 

Finalise the PR and let the maintainers know! <br/>
We can all have a look and discuss the changes. <br/>
