## For the Story tellers

Spearhead. A framework created for the mission maker. <br/>
For those who do want to create a mission with a story and progress, but do not want to get into scripting. Creating an engaging mission can be an incredible feat. First think of the mission, the submission, the placement, the time. Once the concept is done you'll need to place all the objects into the editor. Not too many, but also not too little. Then comes the scripts to make it feel engaging and organic. The latter is probably the biggest hurdle. 

Spearhead is created to try and make this entire process a lot easier.
It keeps track of completed missions, moves the stages forward once all mission are complete. <br/> Manages CAP in an easy to setup way (no scripting required) and gives a lot of possibilities to the mission maker. <br/>
The goal is for the mission maker to focus on the story and the detailed missions, without having to worry about all the triggers and mission management the scripts normally take care off.
