                <h1>About Spearhead</h1>
                <h2>Created by Mission makers, for mission makers</h2>
                <p>
                   I Dutchie, started Spearhead as an idea of making mission making easier for myself and others.<br>
                   On the way I've had a lot of help, in the form of feedback, ideas and most importantly testing from a lot of people. <br>
                   Even though, at the time of writing this, I've written every single line of code myself, I could not have done it without the help of these members.<br>
                   Therefore it's something WE created. 

                   Our goal was very simple, make it possible to make big dynamic missions, without having to either give away all controll or having to get knee deep into scripting. <br>
                   We struck a balance. 

                   

                </p>

                <h2>Hope you enjoy it!</h2>
                <p>
                    All I can say is that I hope that some of you out there will take the step and make a mission! <br>
                    Or, those that are experienced in mission making, will find more joy in making the mission they always wanted to make!<br>
                    If you do, dont hesitate let me and TDCS know! <br>
                    Don't worry, no obligation to let us use it, but any feedback is always welcome! <br>
                    All I really want is to see the DCS community enjoy the Multiplayer environment as much as I do!<br>
