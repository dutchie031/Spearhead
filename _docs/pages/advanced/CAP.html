                <h1>Advanced Tutorial: CAP</h1>
                <p>
                    Setting up CAP can be a challenge. Creating a dynamic environment for your players where enemy aircraft prove a challenge, but is still fun is something that requires some thought. <br>
                    With Spearhead, we tried to make it as easy as possible, but to give you as much control as well. <br>
                    Air combat is so much more than just aircraft flying around. There's intercepts, combat air patrol or maybe fighter sweeps. <br>
                    Sometimes one of these is enough, sometimes creating a network of all three can make it feel like a very dynamic environment. <br>
                    In this tutorial we'll explain how to set up each different type of CAP and we'll finish with some considerations on how to combine them and create an environment we think is fun to play in. <br>

                        Currently a group can do 1 thing. Either be Primary, Seconday, Sweep or Intercept. <br>
                        If you want to have different types during different stages, it's best to copy paste groups and rename them accordingly. <br>
