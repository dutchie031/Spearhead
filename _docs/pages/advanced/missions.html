                <h3>Scenery Targets</h3>
                <p>
                    Bridges, buildings or other type of targets that are baked into the map are awesome targets.<br>
                    We wanted to make sure they were easily integrated in Spearhead.

                    All you will need to do is right click on the scenery object you want added. <br>
                    You will then get the option to "Assign as...", click this and you'll see a new trigger zone created. <br>
                    It's best not to edit the triggerzone, but you can rename it however you like. <br>
                    
                    Scenery objects will always be a specific "target" in the mission. 

                </p>

                <p class="note">Be aware that Object IDs can change when maps are updated and edited and the "Assign as..." action will have to be performed again.</p>
                
                <p>Here's two images showing how a bridge is added to a mission.</p>
