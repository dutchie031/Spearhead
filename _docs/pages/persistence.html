                <p>
                    Spearhead comes with a custom Persistence option. <br />
                    It will even save burned out vehicles to give players a consistent battlefield even after the
                    restart. <br />
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most is pretty straightforward, however, some zones are somewhat special. <br />
                    Underneath you'll see all special zones listed.

                    Since this feature is still very much in development, please let any issues be known as soon as
                    possible and as concise as possible so a fix can be made quickly. <br />
                    Currently implemented is local file storage. <br />
                    If enough interest is expressed, cloud-based persistence would be possible. <br />

                <h2 id="basic-behavior">Basic Behavior</h2>
                <p>
                    While playing the mission, Spearhead is keeping track of all units killed. <br />
                    These units are stored in memory internally and written to file. <br />
                    This happens every 2 minutes AND during the "onMissionStop" event to make sure the mission is as
                    up-to-date as possible without having to call IO methods on each event.<br />
                </p>

                <h2 id="misc-units">Misc Units</h2>
                <p>
                    Miscellaneous units will follow basic behavior. <br />
                    These are units that are part of a stage but are not in a mission or airbase. <br />
                    These units will be replaced by a static "DEAD" unit after a mission restart at the location it was
                    killed. <br />
                    Due to blue units spawning afterwards, it's generally best to not have these units move through or
                    over areas where BLUESAMS and Airbase units will spawn after a stage completion.
                </p>

                <h2 id="missions">Missions</h2>
                <p>
                    Missions follow the same logic as Misc Units. <br />
                </p>

                <h2 id="blue-sams">Blue SAMs</h2>
                <p>
                    For Blue SAMs, due to placements easily overlapping between red and blue units within a BLUESAM
                    trigger zone, red units that overlap with blue units will be deleted. <br />
                    This will ensure that the blue units are placed as needed. <br />
                </p>

                <h2 id="airbases">Airbases</h2>
                <p>
                    Airbase units will also be checked for overlap. As the blue units will be spawned after the RED
                    unit. <br />
                    Units that were alive when the stage was completed will be removed. Units that died will have
                    corpses spawned. <br />
                </p>

                <h2 id="warehouses">Warehouses</h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, warehouses are not implemented and therefore warehouses are not persisted. <br />
                    When supply missions and logistics get implemented, warehouses will be persisted as well. <br />
