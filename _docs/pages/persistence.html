                <p>
                    Spearhead comes with a custom Persistence option. <br/>
                    It will even save burned out vehicles to give players a consistent battlefield even after the restart. <br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most is pretty straightforward, however, some zones are somewhat special. <br/>
                    Underneath you'll see all special zones listed.
                </p>

                    Since this feature is still very much in development, please let any issues be known as soon as possible and as concise as possible so a fix can be made quickly. <br/>
                    Currently implemented is local file storage. <br/>
                    If enough interest is expressed, cloud-based persistence would be possible. <br/>

                <h2 id="basic-behavior">Basic Behavior</h2>
                <p>
                    While playing the mission, Spearhead is keeping track of all units killed. <br/>
                    These units are stored in memory internally and written to file. <br/>
                    This happens every 2 minutes AND during the "onMissionStop" event to make sure the mission is as up-to-date as possible without having to call IO methods on each event.<br/>
                </p>

                <h2 id="misc-units">Misc Units</h2>
                <p>
                    Miscellaneous units will follow basic behavior. <br/>
                    These are units that are part of a stage but are not in a mission or airbase. <br/>
                    These units will be replaced by a static "DEAD" unit after a mission restart at the location it was killed. <br/>
                    Due to blue units spawning afterwards, it's generally best to not have these units move through or over areas where BLUESAMS and Airbase units will spawn after a stage completion.
                </p>

                <h2 id="missions">Missions</h2>
                <p>
                    Missions follow the same logic as Misc Units. <br/>
                </p>

                <h2 id="blue-sams">Blue SAMs</h2>
                <p>
                    For Blue SAMs, due to placements easily overlapping between red and blue units within a BLUESAM trigger zone, red units that overlap with blue units will be deleted. <br/>
                    This will ensure that the blue units are placed as needed. <br/>
                </p>

                <h2 id="airbases">Airbases</h2>
                <p>
                    Airbase units will also be checked for overlap. As the blue units will be spawned after the RED unit. <br/>
                    Units that were alive when the stage was completed will be removed. Units that died will have corpses spawned. <br/>
                </p>

                <h2 id="warehouses">Warehouses</h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, warehouses are not implemented and therefore warehouses are not persisted. <br/>
                    When supply missions and logistics get implemented, warehouses will be persisted as well. <br/>
